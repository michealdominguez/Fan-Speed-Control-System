When the light switch is turned on, the fan will automatically turn on. Once the light and fan are on, a switch can be used to adjust the speed of the fan depending on the individualâ€™s needs. Different combinations of inputs from the switch changes the speed from lowest, low, high, and highest. When the light is turned off, the fan will turn off.
