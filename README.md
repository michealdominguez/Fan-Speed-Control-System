# Fan-Speed-Control-System
When the light switch is turned on, the fan will automatically turn on. Once the light and fan are on, a switch can be used to adjust the speed of the fan depending on the individualâ€™s needs. Different combinations of inputs from the switch changes the speed from lowest, low, high, and highest. When the light is turned off, the fan will turn off. 
The potentiometer in this project was used to signify the light turning on, and subsequently the fan. The 4-input DIP switch is then used to change the speed of the fan under different inputs
